# cs-210

## Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.

This project tackled analyzing the data provided in a crocery shopping lsit and presented that data in different formats


## What did you do particularly well?

I built it in a couple of hours, tops, on a Saturday afternoon.


## Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?

This is some very basic code and could be improved in several different areas. Error detection and correction would be the first place.

Second, the try-catch block wasn't used to its full effectiveness and could be better implemented to include the entire project.

Third, the portability and maintainability of the code could be improved, especially as the GroceryData class controls both the map data and the file I/O.


## Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?

Nothing was incredibly difficult. I had fun writing the t_lowercase member function for GroceryData.


## What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?

I've been a software engineer for over 10 years now. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯


## How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

Program uses basic OO concepts such as abstraction to make maintaining the code easier. Extensibility is possible because of the OO design.

Some parts will need to be redesigned to be more flexible in the future.

Readability is maintained with clear, easy to understand naming conventions. Code is followable without comments.
